This is my code based on CERN-ROOT to handle the output of Delphes. Although it is a little ugly, it takes me long time to finish. The first commit is not the first version of these codes. I've changed a lot since it begin. I hope later I could modify these code to adapt more general case, not only the case I've handled!
